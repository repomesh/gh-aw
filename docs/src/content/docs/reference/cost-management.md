The cost of running an agentic workflow is the sum of two components: **GitHub Actions minutes** consumed by the workflow jobs, and **inference costs** charged by the AI provider for each agent run.

## Cost Components

### GitHub Actions Minutes

Every workflow job consumes Actions compute time billed at standard [GitHub Actions pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions). A typical agentic workflow run includes at least two jobs:

| Job | Purpose | Typical duration |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| Pre-activation / detection | Validates the trigger, runs membership checks, evaluates `skip-if-match` conditions | 10–30 seconds |
| Agent | Runs the AI engine and executes tools | 1–15 minutes |

Each job also incurs approximately 1.5 minutes of runner setup overhead on top of its execution time.

### Inference Costs

The agent job invokes an AI engine to process the prompt and call tools. Inference is billed by the provider:

| Engine | Billed to | Unit |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `copilot` | Account owning [`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#copilot_github_token) | Premium requests (1–2 per run; see [Copilot billing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot)) |
| `claude` | Anthropic account for [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#anthropic_api_key) | Tokens |
| `codex` | OpenAI account for [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#openai_api_key) | Tokens |

> [!NOTE]
> For Copilot, inference is charged to the individual account owning `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, not the repository or organization. Use a dedicated service account to track spend per workflow.

## Monitoring Costs with `gh aw logs`

The `gh aw logs` command surfaces per-run metrics — elapsed duration, token usage, and estimated inference cost — before you decide what to optimize. Use `gh aw audit <run-id>` to deep-dive into a single run's token usage, tool calls, and inference spend; its **Metrics** and **Performance Metrics** sections cover token counts, effective tokens, turn counts, and estimated cost in one place. For cost trends across multiple runs, use `gh aw logs --format markdown [workflow]` to generate a cross-run report with anomaly detection.

### View recent run durations

```bash
# Overview table for all agentic workflows (last 10 runs)
gh aw logs

# Narrow to a single workflow
gh aw logs issue-triage-agent

# Last 30 days for Copilot workflows
gh aw logs --engine copilot --start-date -30d
```

The overview table includes a **Duration** column showing elapsed wall-clock time per run. Because GitHub Actions bills compute time by the minute (rounded up per job), duration is the primary indicator of Actions spend.

### Export metrics as JSON

Use `--json` to get structured output suitable for scripting or trend analysis:

```bash
# Write JSON to a file for further processing
gh aw logs --start-date -1w --json > /tmp/logs.json

# List per-run duration and tokens across all workflows
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '.runs[] | {workflow: .workflow_name, duration: .duration, tokens: .token_usage}'

# Token usage grouped by workflow over the past 30 days
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '[.runs[]] | group_by(.workflow_name) |
  map({workflow: .[0].workflow_name, runs: length, total_tokens: (map(.token_usage) | add // 0)})'
```

Each run under `.runs[]` includes `duration`, `token_usage`, `workflow_name`, and `agent`. For orchestrated workflows, the same JSON includes deterministic lineage under `.episodes[]` and `.edges[]` — see the next section.

### Interpret Episode-Level Usage

`gh aw logs --json` emits three views of the same data: `.runs[]` (individual workflow runs), `.episodes[]` (related runs grouped into one logical execution — orchestrator, workers, `workflow_call` follow-ups, and reporting passes), and `.edges[]` (the inferred parent-child lineage). Use `.runs[]` to find which specific run was resource-heavy; use `.episodes[]` to answer "what did this job use end-to-end?". For non-orchestrated workflows, an episode collapses to a single run and the two views are equivalent.

Useful episode fields for usage analysis:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `total_runs` | Workflow runs in the logical execution |
| `total_tokens` / `total_effective_tokens` | Raw and effective token aggregates; prefer `total_effective_tokens` for Copilot |
| `total_duration` | Wall-clock duration across grouped runs |
| `primary_workflow` | Main workflow label |
| `resource_heavy_node_count` | Runs flagged as resource-heavy |
| `blocked_request_count` | Aggregate blocked-network pressure |

For Copilot runs, `total_effective_tokens` is the most reliable proxy for resource usage — Copilot does not expose billing-grade cost data.

Safe-output actuation also appears in both `gh aw logs --json` (run- and repo-level) and `gh aw audit <run-id>` (under `safe_output_summary`). The relevant fields — `temporary_id_map_status`, `temporary_id_mappings`, `chained_target_count`, `chained_followup_action_count`, `delegated_temp_target_count`, `closed_temp_target_count`, and their repo-level aggregates — show how often a workflow follows up on its own outputs. When `temporary_id_map_status` is `missing` or `invalid`, chain counts fall back to `0` rather than guessing from incomplete data.

```bash
# Top 10 heaviest logical executions over the past 30 days by effective tokens
gh aw logs --start-date -30d --json | \
  jq '[.episodes[] | {episode: .episode_id, workflow: .primary_workflow, runs: .total_runs, effective_tokens: (.total_effective_tokens // 0)}]
      | sort_by(.effective_tokens) | reverse | .[:10]'
```

## Track Costs at Scale with OpenTelemetry

Use `observability.otlp` to stream run telemetry into a central
OpenTelemetry backend when one repository or one `gh aw logs`
report is no longer enough. This is the best fit for
organization-wide dashboards, alerting, and cross-repository cost
analysis.

```aw wrap
observability:
  otlp:
    endpoint: ${{ secrets.OTLP_ENDPOINT }}
    headers:
      Authorization: ${{ secrets.OTLP_TOKEN }}
```

The exported spans include workflow and model metadata such as
`gh-aw.engine.id`, `gen_ai.request.model`,
`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, and
`gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`. Use these attributes to group usage
by workflow, engine, model, repository, or team in the backend of
your choice.

OpenTelemetry is most useful for answering questions such as:
"Which repositories are driving the most token usage?",
"Which model change caused a cost spike?", and
"Which workflows should be moved to a smaller model or stricter
trigger policy?" See [OpenTelemetry](/gh-aw/reference/open-telemetry/)
for the full attribute reference and collector configuration.

## Trigger Frequency and Cost Risk

The primary cost lever for most workflows is how often they run. Some events are inherently high-frequency:

| Trigger type | Risk | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| `push` | High | Every commit to any matching branch fires the workflow |
| `pull_request` | Medium–High | Fires on open, sync, re-open, label, and other subtypes |
| `issues` | Medium–High | Fires on open, close, label, edit, and other subtypes |
| `check_run`, `check_suite` | High | Can fire many times per push in busy repositories |
| `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment` | Medium | Scales with comment activity |
| `schedule` | Low–Predictable | Fires at a fixed cadence; easy to budget |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Low | Human-initiated; naturally rate-limited |

> [!CAUTION]
> Attaching an agentic workflow to `push`, `check_run`, or `check_suite` in an active repository can generate hundreds of runs per day. Start with `schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` while evaluating cost, then move to event-based triggers with safeguards in place.

## Reducing Cost

### Use Deterministic Checks to Skip the Agent

The most effective cost reduction is skipping the agent job entirely when it is not needed. The `skip-if-match` and `skip-if-no-match` conditions run during the low-cost pre-activation job and cancel the workflow before the agent starts:

```aw wrap
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  skip-if-match: 'label:duplicate OR label:wont-fix'
```

```aw wrap
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  skip-if-no-match: 'label:needs-triage'
```

Use these to filter out noise before incurring inference costs. See [Triggers](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/) for the full syntax.

### Choose a Cheaper Model

The `engine.model` field selects the AI model. Smaller or faster models cost significantly less per token while still handling many routine tasks:

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: copilot
  model: gpt-4.1-mini
```

```aw wrap
engine:
  id: claude
  model: claude-haiku-4-5
```

Reserve frontier models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, etc.) for complex tasks. Use lighter models for triage, labeling, summarization, and other structured outputs.

### Limit Context Size

Inference cost scales with prompt size. Write focused prompts, avoid whole-file reads when only a few lines matter, cap result counts in tool calls, and use `imports` to compose a smaller subset of prompt sections at runtime.

### Cap Effective Tokens per Run

Use the top-level `max-effective-tokens` frontmatter field to cap
the effective-token budget for a single workflow run. This provides
a hard stop for unusually expensive runs and a consistent cost
guardrail across all supported engines.

```aw wrap
max-effective-tokens: 5000000
```

Effective tokens are the normalized usage metric described in the
[Effective Tokens Specification](/gh-aw/reference/effective-tokens-specification/).
When the budget is approached, gh-aw emits steering warnings before
the run reaches the limit. Set a negative value only when budget
enforcement must be disabled explicitly.

### Roll out org/repo defaults with enterprise controls

For large installations, set baseline model and token guardrails
once, then let individual workflows override only when needed:

1. Export current defaults:

```bash
gh aw env get defaults.yml --scope org --org MY_ORG
```

2. Update and apply shared defaults in batch:

```yaml
default_max_effective_tokens: "5000000"
default_model_copilot: "gpt-5-mini"
default_model_claude: "claude-haiku-4-5"
default_model_codex: "gpt-5.4-mini"
```

```bash
gh aw env update defaults.yml --scope org --org MY_ORG
```

`gh aw env update` shows a confirmation preview before applying changes.
Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt in automation, or `--dry-run` to preview
without changing any variables. Set a field to `null` to delete the
corresponding variable from the target scope. Unknown YAML keys are rejected,
`default_max_turns` / `default_timeout_minutes` must be positive integers, and
`default_max_effective_tokens` must be a non-zero integer (negative values
disable token steering and budget enforcement).

3. If you compile workflows in CI, pass compiler-read defaults into
the compiler process environment (for example via `${{ vars.* }}`):
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_EFFECTIVE_TOKENS`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`,
`GH_AW_DEFAULT_DETECTION_MODEL`.

> [!TIP]
> `GH_AW_DEFAULT_MODEL_*` values are resolved at workflow runtime via
> `${{ vars.* }}` in compiled YAML, while timeout/max-turns/token
> defaults are read by the compiler process at compile time.

### Rate Limiting and Concurrency

Use `user-rate-limit` to cap how many times a user can trigger the workflow in a given window, and rely on concurrency controls to serialize runs rather than letting them pile up:

```aw wrap
user-rate-limit:
  max-runs-per-window: 3
  window: 60  # 3 runs per hour per user
```

See [Rate Limiting Controls](/gh-aw/reference/rate-limiting-controls/) and [Concurrency](/gh-aw/reference/concurrency/) for details.

### Use Schedules for Predictable Budgets

Scheduled workflows fire at a fixed cadence, making cost easy to estimate and cap:

```aw wrap
schedule: daily on weekdays
```

One scheduled run per weekday = five agent invocations per week. See [Schedule Syntax](/gh-aw/reference/schedule-syntax/) for the full fuzzy schedule syntax.

## Agentic Cost Optimization

The `agentic-workflows` MCP tool exposes the same operations as the CLI (`logs`, `audit`, `status`) to any workflow agent, so a scheduled meta-agent can inspect and optimize other agentic workflows automatically — fetching aggregate cost data, deep-diving into individual runs, and proposing frontmatter changes (cheaper model, tighter `skip-if-match`, lower `user-rate-limit`) via a pull request.

```aw wrap
description: Weekly Actions minutes cost report
on: weekly
permissions:
  actions: read
engine: copilot
tools:
  agentic-workflows:
```

### What to Optimize Automatically

| Signal | Automatic action |
|--------|-----------------|
| High token count per run | Switch to a smaller model (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-haiku-4-5`) |
| Frequent runs with no safe-output produced | Add or tighten `skip-if-match` |
| Long queue times due to concurrency | Lower `user-rate-limit.max-runs-per-window` or add a `concurrency` group |
| Workflow running too often | Change trigger to `schedule` or add `workflow_dispatch` |

> [!NOTE]
> The `agentic-workflows` tool requires `actions: read` permission and is configured under the `tools:` frontmatter key. See [GH-AW as an MCP Server](/gh-aw/reference/gh-aw-as-mcp-server/) for available operations.

## Common Scenario Estimates

These are rough estimates to help with budgeting. Actual costs vary by prompt size, tool usage, model, and provider pricing.

| Scenario | Frequency | Actions minutes/month | Inference/month |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Weekly digest (schedule, 1 repo) | 4×/month | ~1 min | ~4–8 premium requests (Copilot) |
| Issue triage (issues opened, 20/month) | 20×/month | ~10 min | ~20–40 premium requests |
| PR review on every push (busy repo, 100 pushes/month) | 100×/month | ~100 min | ~100–200 premium requests |
| On-demand via slash command | User-controlled | Varies | Varies |

> [!TIP]
> Create separate `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` service accounts per repository or team to attribute spend by workflow.
