GitHub Agentic Workflows add the convenience `slash_command:` trigger to create workflows that respond to `/my-bots` in issues and comments.

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot  # Optional: defaults to filename without .md extension
```

You can also use shorthand formats:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command: "my-bot"  # Shorthand: string directly specifies command name
```

```yaml wrap
on: /my-bot  # Ultra-short: slash prefix automatically expands to slash_command + workflow_dispatch
```

## Multiple Command Identifiers

A single workflow can respond to multiple slash command names by providing an array of command identifiers:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: ["cmd.add", "cmd.remove", "cmd.list"]
```

When triggered, the matched command is available as `needs.activation.outputs.slash_command`, allowing your workflow to determine which command was used:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  slash_command:
    name: ["summarize", "summary", "tldr"]
---

# Multi-Command Handler

You invoked the workflow using: `/${{ needs.activation.outputs.slash_command }}`

Now analyzing the content...
```

This feature enables command aliases and grouped command handlers without workflow duplication.

This automatically creates issue/PR triggers (`opened`, `edited`, `reopened`), comment triggers (`created`, `edited`), and conditional execution matching `/command-name` mentions.

**Code availability:** When a command is triggered from a pull request body, PR comment, or PR review comment, the coding agent has access to both the PR branch and the default branch.

The command must be the **first word** of the comment or body text to trigger the workflow. This prevents accidental triggers when the command is mentioned elsewhere in the content.

You can combine `slash_command:` with other events like `workflow_dispatch` or `schedule`:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule: weekly on monday
```

### Centralized trigger strategy

Set `on.slash_command.strategy: centralized` to opt a workflow into centralized slash-command routing.
When enabled, the workflow compiles as `workflow_dispatch`-centric, and the compiler generates one
shared `agentic_commands.yml` workflow that listens to merged slash-command events and
dispatches matching target workflows with `aw_context`.

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
    strategy: centralized
```

**Note**: With default inline strategy, you cannot combine `slash_command` with `issues`, `issue_comment`, or `pull_request` as they would conflict. With `strategy: centralized`, non-slash events are preserved because slash matching is handled in the generated central trigger workflow.

**Exception for Label-Only Events**: You CAN combine `slash_command` with `issues` or `pull_request` if those events are configured for label-only triggers (`labeled` or `unlabeled` types only). This allows workflows to respond to slash commands while also reacting to label changes.

### Combining `slash_command` with `bots:`

:::caution[Concurrency clash]
Combining `slash_command` with `on.bots:` produces a compile-time warning. When a bot listed in `bots:` posts a comment that begins with the slash command text (e.g., `/command-name`), the command check passes and the bot triggers the workflow — occupying the concurrency slot and potentially blocking a simultaneous manual invocation, since `cancel-in-progress` is disabled for command-trigger workflows.

To ensure the workflow only runs on explicit user commands, remove the `bots:` field.
:::

```yaml wrap
# This configuration produces a compile-time warning:
on:
  slash_command:
    name: rust-review
    events: [pull_request, pull_request_comment]
  bots:
    - "copilot[bot]"
```

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command: deploy
  issues:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]  # Valid: label-only triggers don't conflict
```

This pattern is useful when you want a workflow that can be triggered both manually via commands and automatically when labels change.

## Filtering Command Events

By default, command triggers listen to all comment-related events, which can create skipped runs in the Actions UI. Use the `events:` field to restrict where commands are active:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
    events: [issues, issue_comment]  # Only in issue bodies and issue comments
```

**Supported events:** `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `discussion`, `discussion_comment`, or `*` (all, default).

:::note
Both `issue_comment` and `pull_request_comment` map to GitHub Actions' `issue_comment` event with automatic filtering to distinguish between issue and PR comments.
:::

### Example command workflow

Issue-only command (avoids skipped runs from PR events):

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: investigate
    events: [issues, issue_comment]
```

PR-only command:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: code-review
    events: [pull_request, pull_request_comment]
```

## Context Text

All workflows access `steps.sanitized.outputs.text`, which provides **sanitized** context: for issues and PRs, it's `title + "\n\n" + body`; for comments and reviews, it's the body content.

```aw wrap
# Analyze this content: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"
```

**Why sanitized context?** The sanitized text neutralizes @mentions and bot triggers (like `fixes #123`), protects against XML injection, filters URIs to trusted HTTPS domains, limits content size (0.5MB max, 65k lines), and strips ANSI escape sequences.

**Comparison:**
```aw wrap
# RECOMMENDED: Secure sanitized context
Analyze this issue: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

# DISCOURAGED: Raw context values (security risks)
Title: "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
Body: "${{ github.event.issue.body }}"
```

## Reactions and Status Comments

Command workflows enable `reaction: eyes` (👀) and `status-comment: true` by default. The reaction adds a visual indicator to triggering comments; the status comment posts a started/completed notification with a workflow run link.

Customize or disable either:

```yaml wrap
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
  reaction: "rocket"       # Override default "eyes"
  status-comment: false    # Disable the status comment
```

To disable the reaction entirely, use `reaction: none`.

See [Reactions and Status Comments](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/#reactions-reaction) for all available reactions and detailed behavior.

## Slash Commands in SideRepoOps

GitHub Actions only delivers events to the repository where they occur. With [SideRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/side-repo-ops/) — where workflows live in a separate side repository — events from the main repository are never delivered there. **Slash command triggers cannot be used directly in a SideRepoOps workflow.**

The recommended solution is a **bridge pattern**: a thin relay workflow in the main repository receives the slash command and forwards it to the side repository via `workflow_dispatch`.

See [Slash Commands in SideRepoOps](/gh-aw/patterns/side-repo-ops/#slash-commands) for a full walkthrough with examples and trade-offs.
