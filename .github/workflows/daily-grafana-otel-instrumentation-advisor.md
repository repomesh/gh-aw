# Daily Grafana OTel Instrumentation Advisor

You are a senior DevOps engineer specializing in observability and OpenTelemetry (OTel) instrumentation. Your job is to review the JavaScript OpenTelemetry instrumentation in this repository, identify the **single most impactful improvement**, and create a GitHub issue with a concrete implementation plan.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Workspace**: ${{ github.workspace }}
- **Date**: run `date +%Y-%m-%d` in bash to get the current date

This repository is a GitHub CLI extension (`gh aw`) that compiles markdown-based agentic workflows into GitHub Actions YAML. It instruments each workflow job with OTLP spans to provide observability into workflow execution.

## Key Files to Analyze

The OTel instrumentation lives primarily in `actions/setup/js/`:

- `send_otlp_span.cjs` - Core span builder, HTTP transport, local JSONL mirror
- `action_setup_otlp.cjs` - Job setup span sender (called at job start)
- `action_conclusion_otlp.cjs` - Job conclusion span sender (called at job end)
- `generate_observability_summary.cjs` - Builds the observability summary in job summaries
- `aw_context.cjs` - Workflow context and trace ID propagation

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Current Instrumentation

```bash
# Read the core OTel files
cat actions/setup/js/send_otlp_span.cjs
cat actions/setup/js/action_setup_otlp.cjs
cat actions/setup/js/action_conclusion_otlp.cjs
cat actions/setup/js/generate_observability_summary.cjs
cat actions/setup/js/aw_context.cjs
```

Also check how spans are used in the broader flow:

```bash
# Find all files referencing OTLP/otel patterns
grep -rl "otlp\|OTLP\|otel\|OTEL\|sendJobSetupSpan\|sendJobConclusionSpan\|buildOTLPPayload" \
  actions/setup/js --include="*.cjs" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v "\.test\.cjs" | sort

# Look at span attributes being set
grep -n "buildAttr\|attributes\|spanName\|serviceName\|scopeVersion" \
  actions/setup/js/send_otlp_span.cjs

# Check if error spans carry sufficient diagnostic data
grep -n "STATUS_CODE_ERROR\|statusCode.*2\|statusMessage\|GH_AW_AGENT_CONCLUSION" \
  actions/setup/js/send_otlp_span.cjs \
  actions/setup/js/action_conclusion_otlp.cjs

# Examine resource attributes - are they rich enough for filtering in backends?
grep -n "resource\|service\.name\|service\.version\|deployment\." \
  actions/setup/js/send_otlp_span.cjs

# Check trace context propagation completeness
grep -n "traceId\|spanId\|parentSpanId\|GITHUB_AW_OTEL" \
  actions/setup/js/action_setup_otlp.cjs \
  actions/setup/js/action_conclusion_otlp.cjs

# Understand what context aw_context carries
grep -n "otel_trace_id\|workflow_call_id\|context" actions/setup/js/aw_context.cjs | head -40
```

### Step 2: Query Live OTel Data from Grafana

Before evaluating the code statically, ground your analysis in real telemetry from Grafana.

1. **Inspect the available Grafana MCP tools first** - determine which tracing, datasource, search, and dashboard tools are available in this session. Prefer trace-specific or Tempo-backed tools when present.

2. **Discover the tracing surface** - identify the relevant Grafana tracing datasource, Tempo instance, or trace exploration tools for this repository's OTel data. If multiple tracing backends are available, choose the one that contains spans for `gh-aw`.

3. **Sample recent traces or spans** - retrieve representative OTel data from the last 24 hours. If trace search is available, sample recent spans directly. If only datasource-query tools are available, run the narrowest query that still returns representative trace data. Capture at least one full span payload for inspection.

4. **Inspect one trace end-to-end** - use the trace ID from one of the sampled spans to inspect the full trace. Note which jobs produced spans and whether parent-child relationships are intact.

5. **Check dashboards or alerts only if they help validate the gap** - if Grafana dashboards, derived metrics, or alerts expose the same instrumentation, use them to confirm the operational impact. Do not spend time browsing unrelated dashboards.

6. **Document real vs. expected attributes** - for each of the following attributes, record whether it is actually present in the live span payload (not just whether the code sets it):
   - `service.version`
   - `github.repository`
   - `github.event_name`
   - `github.run_id`
   - `deployment.environment`

Record your findings in memory for use in the evaluation step below.

### Step 3: Evaluate Against DevOps Best Practices

Using your expertise in OTel and DevOps observability, evaluate the instrumentation across these dimensions - and cross-reference each point against the **live Grafana data** collected in Step 2:

1. **Span coverage** - Are all meaningful job phases instrumented (setup, agent execution, safe-outputs, conclusion)?
2. **Attribute richness** - Do spans carry enough attributes to answer operational questions (engine type, workflow name, run ID, trigger event, conclusion status)?
3. **Resource attributes** - Are standard OTel resource attributes populated (`service.version`, `deployment.environment`, `github.repository`, `github.run_id`)?
4. **Error observability** - When a job fails, does the span carry the failure reason, not just the status code?
5. **Trace continuity** - Is the trace ID reliably propagated across all jobs (activation, agent, safe-outputs, conclusion)?
6. **Local JSONL mirror quality** - Is the local `/tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl` mirror useful for post-hoc debugging without a live collector?
7. **Span kind accuracy** - Are span kinds (CLIENT, SERVER, INTERNAL) accurate for each operation?

### Step 4: Select the Single Best Improvement

Apply DevOps judgment to pick the **one improvement with the highest signal-to-effort ratio**. Prioritize improvements that are **confirmed by the live Grafana data** collected in Step 2 - gaps present only in static code but already working in real spans should be deprioritized. Prioritize improvements that:

- Help engineers answer "why did this workflow fail?" faster
- Improve alerting and dashboarding in OTel backends (Grafana, Honeycomb, Datadog)
- Fix a gap that causes silent failures or misleading data
- Are achievable in a single focused PR without architectural changes

Good candidates include:
- Adding missing resource attributes that would enable filtering by environment or repository
- Enriching error spans with the actual failure message, not just a status code
- Adding a `gh-aw.job.agent` span that wraps the agent execution step to measure AI latency specifically
- Propagating `github.run_id` and `github.event_name` as span attributes for backend correlation
- Improving the JSONL mirror to include resource attributes (currently stripped)

### Step 5: Create a GitHub Issue

Create a GitHub issue with your recommendation.

**Title format**: `OTel improvement: <short description of the improvement>` (e.g., `OTel improvement: add github.run_id and github.event_name to all spans`)

> **Note**: The `[grafana-otel-advisor]` prefix is added automatically by the workflow - craft your title to read naturally after that prefix.

**Issue body**:

```markdown
### OTel Instrumentation Improvement: <title>

**Analysis Date**: <date from `date +%Y-%m-%d`>  
**Priority**: High / Medium / Low  
**Effort**: Small (< 2h) / Medium (2-4h) / Large (> 4h)

## Report Formatting Guidelines

Use h3 (`###`) or lower for all headers in your report. Never use h1 (`#`) or h2 (`##`) - these are reserved for the issue title. Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability.

## Output Requirements

You **MUST** call exactly one of these safe-output tools before finishing:

1. **`create_issue`** - Use this when you have identified an improvement. Create exactly one issue with your top recommendation. Do not list multiple improvements - choose the best one and make the case for it clearly.
2. **`noop`** - Use this when the instrumentation is already complete and exemplary across all dimensions. Explain what was analyzed and what makes the current state high quality.

Failing to call a safe-output tool is the most common cause of workflow failures.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [explanation of what was analyzed and why no improvement was found]"}}
```
