# Safe Output Outcome Evaluation Specification

Every safe output type has a measurable outcome. This spec defines the exact evaluation logic for each type: what to check, how to classify the outcome, and what OTel attributes to emit.

## Principles

1. **Same as a human would check.** If a human did this action, how would you know it was good?
2. **Level 2 only.** We check whether the action stuck, not whether it caused downstream effects.
3. **Bot-aware.** Distinguish bot-initiated closes/edits from human ones.
4. **Time-bounded.** Check outcomes after a configurable delay (default: 48 hours).

## Outcome Categories

Every evaluation produces one of these outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `accepted` | The action was kept, merged, resolved, or engaged with |
| `rejected` | The action was undone, closed-as-not-planned, removed, or reverted |
| `ignored` | No human interaction within the evaluation window |
| `pending` | The object has not reached a terminal state yet |
| `lifecycle` | Closed/removed by the workflow itself (e.g., `close-older-issues`) — not a rejection |

## Common OTel Attributes

Every outcome span carries these attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.type` | string | Safe output type (e.g., `create_pull_request`) |
| `ghaw.outcome.result` | string | One of: `accepted`, `rejected`, `ignored`, `pending`, `lifecycle` |
| `ghaw.outcome.object_url` | string | GitHub URL of the affected object |
| `ghaw.outcome.object_number` | int | Issue/PR/discussion number |
| `ghaw.outcome.repo` | string | `owner/repo` |
| `ghaw.outcome.source_run_id` | string | Workflow run that created this output |
| `ghaw.outcome.source_trace_id` | string | Original OTLP trace ID |
| `ghaw.outcome.created_at` | string | When the safe output was executed |
| `ghaw.outcome.checked_at` | string | When this evaluation ran |
| `ghaw.outcome.time_to_outcome_hours` | float | Hours from creation to terminal state |
| `ghaw.outcome.human_comments` | int | Human (non-bot) comments on the object |
| `ghaw.outcome.human_edits` | int | Human edits before acceptance (0 = zero-touch) |
| `ghaw.outcome.zero_touch` | bool | Accepted with no human modifications |

---

## 1. `create_pull_request`

**Question:** Was the PR merged?

**API:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}`

**Evaluation:**

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| `merged == true` | `accepted` |
| `state == "closed"` and `merged == false` | `rejected` |
| `state == "open"` | `pending` |

**Extra signals:**
- `human_edits`: count commits pushed by users other than the PR author after creation
- `human_comments`: count non-bot comments on the PR
- `zero_touch`: `accepted` and `human_edits == 0`
- `time_to_outcome_hours`: `merged_at - created_at` or `closed_at - created_at`

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.merged` | bool | Whether PR was merged |
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.review_count` | int | Number of reviews submitted |
| `ghaw.outcome.pr.additions` | int | Lines added |

| `state == "closed"` and `state_reason == "not_planned"` and closed by human | `rejected` |
| `state == "open"` and has human comments | `pending` (engaged) |
| `state == "open"` and no human comments | `ignored` |

**Bot detection:** check the close event in `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/timeline` — if the actor is `github-actions[bot]`, classify as `lifecycle` not `rejected`.

**Extra signals:**
- `human_comments`: non-bot comments
- Reactions on the issue body

**Additional OTel attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ghaw.outcome.issue.state_reason` | string | `completed` or `not_planned` |

## Derived Metrics

From the outcome evaluations above, compute:

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `acceptance_rate` | accepted / (accepted + rejected) | How often actions are kept |
| `waste_rate` | rejected / total | How often actions are undone |
| `ignore_rate` | ignored / total | How often actions get no response |
| `zero_touch_rate` | zero_touch / accepted | How often accepted actions need no human edits |
| `time_to_outcome` | median(time_to_outcome_hours) | How fast outcomes resolve |
| `cost_per_accepted_outcome` | total_run_cost / accepted_count | Efficiency metric |

## Implementation Priority

Start with the 5 highest-value, lowest-effort types:

1. `create_pull_request` — cleanest signal, most valuable
2. `create_issue` — common, needs bot-aware close detection
3. `add_comment` — very common, engagement signal
4. `add_labels` — simple binary check
5. `assign_to_agent` — important for delegation workflows

These cover the majority of safe output usage. Add the rest incrementally.
